# Fibonacci Bollinger Bands MT5

This code is an example of how the Fibonacci Bollinger Bands MT5 trading robot works. The official trading robot is developed and published on the MQL5 website by forexroboteasy.com. This code is not an exact copy of the original product, but it provides an approximate description of the necessary parameters for the operation of the trading robot.

## Description

The Fibonacci Bollinger Bands MT5 trading robot uses the Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands to identify potential trading opportunities. It calculates the Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands based on the input parameters set by the user.

The input parameters for the trading robot are as follows:

- `fibonacciLevels`: Number of Fibonacci levels to be used.
- `maMethod`: Moving average type for the Bollinger Bands.
- `appliedPrice`: Price data source for the Bollinger Bands.

The trading robot initializes by calculating the Fibonacci levels using the custom indicator 'Fibonacci'. It then calculates the Bollinger Bands using the `iBands` function.

On each tick, the trading robot checks if the price is approaching any Fibonacci level. If the price is within a certain range of a Fibonacci level, it sends a notification indicating that the price is approaching that level.

The trading robot also checks if the price is crossing above or below the Bollinger Bands. If the price crosses above the upper Bollinger Band, it sends a notification indicating that the price is crossing above the upper Bollinger Band. If the price crosses below the lower Bollinger Band, it sends a notification indicating that the price is crossing below the lower Bollinger Band.

The trading robot cleans up its resources on deinitialization.
